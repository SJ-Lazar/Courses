    //What is automated testing?
    //Automated testing is the process of writing code to test your code.
    //Production code - the code that is written to solve the problem
    //Test code - the code that is written to test the production code


    //Without Automated Testing as the code grows the timw to test the code grows exponentially
    //With Automated Testing as the code grows the time to test the code grows linearly
    //Automated testing is a way to reduce the time it takes to test your code
    //Refactoring - the process of changing the code without changing the functionality of the code
    //Automated testing is a way to refactor your code without breaking your code

    //Types of Tests 
    //Unit Tests - tests a single unit of code with its external dependencies -- fast and cheap
    //Integration Tests - tests how multiple units of code work together with its external dependencies -- longer and more expensive
    //End to End Tests - =Drive the application through the UI -- slowest and most expensive

    //Favour unit tests over integration tests
    //Favour integration tests over end to end tests
    //Use end to end sparingly
