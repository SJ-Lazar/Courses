    //What is asynchronous programming?
    //Asynchronous programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.
    //Asynchronous programming has been gaining a lot of traction in the past few years, and for good reason. It can help improve the responsiveness of your application.
    //Asynchronous programming is essential for developing responsive user interfaces, and it's also useful when accessing web services.
    //Asynchronous programming is supported in C# through the use of async/await keywords.
    //Asynchronous programming is not multithreading. It is a higher level concept. It is a way to write code that is more responsive to user interaction without blocking the main thread.

    //What is the difference between asynchronous and parallel programming?
    //Asynchronous programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.
    //Parallel programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs simultaneously on multiple threads. Parallel programming is useful for executing computationally intensive tasks faster on multicore computers.

    //What is the difference between asynchronous and synchronous programming?
    //Synchronous programming is a means of programming in which a unit of work runs and completes before the next unit is started. Asynchronous programming is a means of programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.

    //What is the difference between asynchronous and non-blocking programming?
    //Asynchronous programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.
    //Non-blocking programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.

    //What is the difference between asynchronous and multithreaded programming?
    //Asynchronous programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.
    //Multithreaded programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs simultaneously on multiple threads. Multithreading is useful when a program has to perform multiple tasks at the same time.

    //What is the difference between asynchronous and event-driven programming?
    //Asynchronous programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.
    //Event-driven programming is a means of programming in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads.
